    Main OverOps API.
    The REST API layer enables OverOps admins and users to perform and automate all actions
    provided by the OverOps UI available at https://app.overops.com (or On-premises equivalent URL) via a platform independent programmatic interface.
    A wrapper Java client API library that leverages these APIs for convenience by
    Java and Scala developers is available at https://github.com/takipi/api-client and on Maven Central.

    All calls must be authenticated using one of the following methods:
      1. Using `x-api-key` header (To generate the token, go to `Settings` --> `Account Settings` in the OverOps App). This is the recommended method.
      2. Using Basic auth with `username:password` combo.
